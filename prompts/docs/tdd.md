### 4. Implementation plan (commit-level)

Each step below should correspond to a single, meaningful commit. Each step should include both the functionality and the test(s) for it. Don't write tests in separate steps. Except if the implementation requires a system test. If so, add the system test as the last step.

| Step | Commit Description            | What to Test (first)          | Purpose                      |
| ---- | ----------------------------- | ----------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| 1    | Implement X                   | Test this or that             | Enforces expected behavior   |
| 2    | Implement Y                   | Test this or that             | Initial logic pass           |
| 3    | Refactor Z to improve clarity | All tests should remain green | Clean up for maintainability |
| ...  |                               |                               |                              |
